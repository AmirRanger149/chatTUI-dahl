# chatTUI

`chatTUI` is a small, fast terminal chat client for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
Gemini, and any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint you add yourself. It is built
in Rust and designed for people who prefer a focused keyboard workflow over a
browser window.

The app uses `ratatui` for the interface, `crossterm` for terminal input,
`tokio` for asynchronous work, and `reqwest` for native SSE streaming.

## What You Get

- Live responses as the selected model generates them
- An always-on composer with a `Working` / `Thinking` status row while streaming
- Scrollable conversation view
- Local conversation history saved as JSON
- History drawer for returning to previous chats
- Three built-in providers — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini
- Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints (Dahl, APInex, Ollama, Groq, OpenRouter,
  …) configured directly in `config.json` with your own base URL and key
- `/model` picker that lists the models the API actually offers (`GET /models`)
  and marks the active one
- Automatic fallback: if a model rejects the request or is at high demand,
  chatTUI switches to another available model and announces the switch
- Markdown-friendly response output with shaded code boxes
- Copy any code block from a response to the clipboard (`ctrl+g` or `/code`)
- Animated reasoning view for thinking models such as `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7`
  (see [Reasoning Models](#reasoning-models))
- A single native Rust binary with no Python or OpenAI SDK dependency

## Before You Start

You need:

- Rust and Cargo from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- An API key for at least one provider: [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/),
  [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/),
  or any OpenAI-compatible gateway (e.g. [Dahl Inference](https://inference.dahl.global/),
  [APInex](https://api.apinex.bond/v1), a local Ollama)

Check your Rust installation:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## Install

Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirRanger149/chatTUI.git
cd chatTUI
```

Build the optimized release binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Or run directly while developing:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Configuration (`config.json`)

`chatTUI` looks for `config.json` in the application directory or the current working directory.

There are two kinds of providers:

- **The 3 main providers** — `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini` — are built in.
  You only set their API keys.
- **Custom providers** — any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint — are defined by
  you under `custom_providers`, with the base URL and API key right in
  `config.json`.

### Full & Complete `config.json` Template

Create a `config.json` file in your root folder:

```json
{
  "openai_api_key": "sk-openai-your-key-here",
  "anthropic_api_key": "sk-ant-your-key-here",
  "gemini_api_key": "AIza-your-key-here",
  "custom_providers": [
    {
      "id": "dahl",
      "name": "Dahl",
      "base_url": "https://inference.dahl.global/v1",
      "api_key": "your-dahl-key-here",
      "model": "MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7"
    },
    {
      "id": "apinex",
      "name": "APInex",
      "base_url": "https://api.apinex.bond/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-apx-your-apinex-key-here"
    }
  ],
  "provider": "dahl",
  "temperature": 0.7
}
```

### The 3 Main Providers

Each of these only needs a key — the endpoints and default models are built in.

**For OpenAI:**
```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "openai_api_key": "sk-openai-your-key-here"
}
```

**For Anthropic:**
```json
{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "anthropic_api_key": "sk-ant-your-key-here"
}
```

**For Gemini:**
```json
{
  "provider": "gemini",
  "gemini_api_key": "AIza-your-key-here"
}
```

### Custom Providers (`custom_providers`)

Any OpenAI-compatible API can be added under `custom_providers`. Each entry is
a `POST /chat/completions` endpoint with your base URL and key:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Unique id used with `/provider <id>` and the `provider` field (lowercase recommended) |
| `name` | Optional display name (defaults to the id) |
| `base_url` | OpenAI-compatible base URL, e.g. `https://inference.dahl.global/v1` |
| `api_key` | API key; the `{ID}_API_KEY` environment variable is the fallback |
| `model` | Optional default model; when omitted, chatTUI picks one from the endpoint's live model list (a `free/` model first) |

**Example — one custom provider (Dahl):**
```json
{
  "custom_providers": [
    {
      "id": "dahl",
      "name": "Dahl",
      "base_url": "https://inference.dahl.global/v1",
      "api_key": "your-dahl-key-here",
      "model": "MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7"
    }
  ],
  "provider": "dahl"
}
```

**Example — several custom providers side by side:**
```json
{
  "custom_providers": [
    {
      "id": "groq",
      "name": "Groq",
      "base_url": "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1",
      "api_key": "gsk-your-groq-key-here",
      "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
    },
    {
      "id": "ollama",
      "name": "Ollama (local)",
      "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1",
      "model": "llama3.2"
    },
    {
      "id": "apinex",
      "name": "APInex",
      "base_url": "https://api.apinex.bond/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-apx-your-apinex-key-here"
    }
  ]
}
```

Switch between all providers with the `/provider` popup (custom entries are
marked `· custom`) or directly with `/provider openai|anthropic|gemini|<custom-id>`.

> **Note:** If only one provider has an API key in `config.json`, chatTUI will
> automatically set that provider as the active default on startup. If several
> keys are present, the first provider in the list that has a key (OpenAI,
> Anthropic, Gemini, then your custom providers in file order) is selected by
> default and you can switch between them anytime using the `/provider`
> command — or set `provider` explicitly.

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openai_api_key` | API key for OpenAI | `None` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY` env) |
| `anthropic_api_key` | API key for Anthropic | `None` (or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env) |
| `gemini_api_key` | API key for Google Gemini | `None` (or `GEMINI_API_KEY` env) |
| `custom_providers` | Your own OpenAI-compatible endpoints (see table above) | `[]` |
| `provider` | Active provider id (`openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, or a custom id) | First provider with a key |
| `temperature` | Sampling temperature for responses | `0.7` |
| `model` | Optional model name override for the active provider | Provider default |
| `base_url` | Optional endpoint override for the active provider | Provider default |

> **Deprecated fields still work.** Older configs that use `dahl_api_key`,
> `apinex_api_key`, or the legacy single `api_key` field keep working: those
> fields are automatically migrated into equivalent `custom_providers` entries
> on startup (Dahl → `https://inference.dahl.global/v1`, APInex →
> `https://api.apinex.bond/v1`). New configs should use `custom_providers`.

> **Endpoints & models.** Each provider's endpoint/model can be overridden
> with `{ID}_BASE_URL` / `{ID}_MODEL` environment variables (e.g.
> `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, `DAHL_BASE_URL`) — this works for
> custom providers too.

### Environment Variables (Alternative)

You can also export environment variables instead of creating a `config.json`:

```bash
# The 3 main providers
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."

# Custom providers: {ID}_API_KEY, built from the uppercased id
export DAHL_API_KEY="your-dahl-key"
export APINEX_API_KEY="sk-apx..."

# Optional endpoint/model overrides for any provider
export DAHL_BASE_URL="https://inference.dahl.global/v1"
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash"

cargo run --release
```

## Using chatTUI

The composer is always focused — just start typing and press `Enter` to send.

### Keyboard

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Send the message |
| `Shift+Enter` | Newline in the composer |
| `Esc` | Close a popup, then interrupt a running stream, then clear the composer |
| `Ctrl+T` | Conversation history |
| `Ctrl+G` | Browse and copy code blocks |
| `Ctrl+R` | Show / hide model reasoning |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Scroll the transcript |
| `Up` / `Down` | Recall previous prompts |
| `←` / `→` | Move the cursor (`Ctrl` jumps whole words) |
| `Ctrl+U` | Clear the composer |
| `?` | Keyboard shortcuts |
| `Ctrl+C` ×2 | Quit |

### Slash commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/help` | Show keyboard shortcuts |
| `/new` | Start a new conversation |
| `/history` | Browse saved conversations |
| `/code` | Browse and copy code blocks |
| `/model` | Pick a model from the API's live list (`/model <id>` sets one directly) |
| `/provider` | Select API provider (`/provider <name>` sets one directly) |
| `/quit` | Exit chatTUI |

Type `/` to open the command palette, then `Tab` to complete.

### Clipboard

`ctrl+g` / `/code` copies through your system clipboard when a clipboard tool
is available — `pbcopy` on macOS, `clip` on Windows, `wl-copy` / `xclip` /
`xsel` on Linux — so the copy is verified. Otherwise chatTUI falls back to the
terminal's OSC 52 sequence (with tmux/screen passthrough, and automatically
over SSH), which is best-effort: if pasting comes up empty, install `wl-copy`
(Wayland) or `xclip` (X11), or enable OSC 52 clipboard support in your
terminal.

## Reasoning Models

Some models expose their private chain of thought by wrapping it in
`<think> … </think>` before the actual answer. `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7` — the
Dahl example's default model — is one of them. chatTUI understands that format
and gives it its own animated treatment instead of dumping raw tags into the
transcript.

**While the model is thinking**, the status row above the composer turns into a
shimmering indicator with a live preview of the thought being written:

```text
✻ Thinking (7s • esc to interrupt)  comparing the two approaches
```

The transcript shows the reasoning as a dim, italic block behind a `┃` rule,
kept to the last few lines so it never pushes the answer off screen.

**Once the answer starts**, the block collapses into a single quiet summary line:

```text
✻ Thought for 84 words  ▸ ctrl+r
```

Press `Ctrl+R` at any time to expand or collapse completed reasoning blocks.

Notes:

- Reasoning is never replayed back to the API on later turns, so it does not
  consume context or confuse the model.
- Interrupting a stream mid-thought (`Esc`) still leaves a tidy, collapsible block.
- Models that do not emit `<think>` tags are unaffected — you get the usual
  `• Working` indicator and plain markdown output.

## Models And Endpoints

Each provider has a default model, and you can change it with `{ID}_MODEL`,
the `model` value in your config (or config file `model` override for the
active provider), or `/model`. The model name must be available through the
provider; retrieve current model IDs from its `GET /models` endpoint.

A custom endpoint must support:

```text
POST /chat/completions
```

and, for the `/model` picker and automatic fallback:

```text
GET /models
```

### Availability-Based Default (Custom Providers)

Some gateways serve a rotating list of models — including free models
published under the `free/` namespace, e.g. `free/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` on
APInex — so a hardcoded default model can disappear or be replaced. When a
custom provider's entry omits `model` (at startup, or after switching to it
with `/provider`), chatTUI fetches its live `GET /models` list in the
background and sets the default model from what is actually available:

1. the first free model (`free/…`), or
2. the first model in the live list.

The pick is announced in the transcript (e.g.
`APInex default set to available free model: free/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`).
An explicit choice always wins — a model set with `{ID}_MODEL`, the entry's
`model` field, or `/model` is never overridden — and if the fetch fails the
send-time fallback still covers it. The fetched list doubles as the cached
list shown by the `/model` picker. Pin a `model` in the entry whenever you
want a stable default instead.

### The `/model` Picker

Run `/model` with no argument and chatTUI queries the endpoint's `GET /models`,
then shows what is actually available in a popup: your current model is marked
`· active` and preselected, `↑↓` (or `PgUp` / `PgDn`) move through the list,
and `Enter` switches to the highlighted model. Press `r` to refetch the list
from the API and `esc` to close. The list is cached for five minutes so
reopening the picker is instant.

`/model <id>` still sets a model directly. When a fetched list is cached, the
id is resolved against it — exact match (case-insensitive), then a unique
prefix, then a unique suffix — so both `/model minimaxai/minimax-m2.7` and the
shorthand `/model minimax-m2.7` find `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7`. Anything
ambiguous or unknown is set exactly as typed.

### Automatic Model Fallback

When a send fails because of the model — a bad request against it, a
model that no longer exists, throttling, or the classic "currently
experiencing high demand" overload — chatTUI fetches the endpoint's model
list, picks another available model (preferring one from the same family,
e.g. another `MiniMaxAI/…`), and retries. Every switch is announced in the
transcript, so you always know which model answered:

```text
⚠ MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7 is unavailable — the model rejected the request (HTTP 429: rate limit exceeded)
  switching to MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M1
```

Up to three fallbacks are tried per message, and the request is only retried
before any output has been written — a stream that breaks mid-answer is
reported as-is instead of being spliced onto a second model. Authentication
failures are reported immediately, since a different model cannot fix those.

## Saved Data

Conversation history is stored in the platform data directory, normally:

```text
~/.local/share/chatTUI/chat-tui/sessions.json
```

The history file contains your saved messages. Back it up if you need to keep
your conversations, and protect it if they contain private information.

## Troubleshooting

**The app says the API key is missing**

Set the active provider's key — `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or
`GEMINI_API_KEY` for the built-ins, or the `api_key` of your custom provider
in `config.json` (its `{ID}_API_KEY` environment variable works too).

**The model is rejected**

Type `/model` to pick from the list the API actually offers. If a request is
rejected by a model that is overloaded or no longer available, chatTUI
automatically retries with another available model and tells you in the
transcript.

**The request fails or times out**

Check your network connection, API quota, endpoint URL (`base_url` in the
custom provider's entry), and API key. A custom endpoint must support
OpenAI-compatible streaming responses.

**A key was exposed**

Revoke it at the provider it belongs to and create a replacement.
